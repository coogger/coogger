        <h1>Deleting your user account</h1>
        <h2>You can delete your Coogger user account at any time.</h2>
        <p>
            Deleting your user account removes all topics, bookmarks, votes, views, comments owned by your account.
            Issues and contributions you've made in topics owned by other users will not be 
            deleted - instead, they'll be associated with our <a general="color:primary" href="/@ghost">@Ghost</a> user.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            If you delete your account, you will never be able to log in to the coogger again.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            To delete your account, just send an email to 
                {% include 'forms/create_form.html' %}
        </p>
    </div>
