## About coogger project

<center>![](https://steemitimages.com/256x512/https://i.imgur.com/VoxUZQb.png)</center>

## Who am I?
I am an electrical engineering student, I learned software from the internet and I try to make new projects or products constantly to improve myself, I think I learned the software in a shorter time by do like that.

## The Story of Coogger Project
Before I started doing the project, I read the following advice from the internet: 'I think everyone should keep a blog, if they share any topics on they know, other people will know  the topics too and people who share will have a note that will look after' I wanted to open my own blog site, but I must code it myself because I am a developer who encodes and reinforces the topics I have learned.

Then I thought, why do I only do a blog page for myself, must make a blog page for everyone, I think that everyone can learn everything if they write what they know.

Then the valerian film went into vision, there was a space station on the first scene of this film. All kinds of aliens communities come to this space station and were categorized according to their expertise. The aliens were doing their best work in this station and the technology and the station was developing fast on this track.

A few friends had shared content after I took to live the project. I was thinking of how they could make money people who share in Coogger, and I wanted to look for alternative ways of advertising. then I met steem and everything about my life changed, and then I had a great excitement because my dream could be real now, it could be a space station where communities come together, categorize their contents could share on any communities and make money for it.

## What is coogger?
Coogger is a project which can work with communities, it provides them a steem blockchain-based web platform and management, In addition, users can share content from all coogger communities and earn STEEM, In addition, the project is open source.

The Steemkitchen community was the first community to work with coogger.

After the community settings were done immediately, and after connecting the domain address to the server, it started working with coogger.

Communities which works with coogger are connected to the same server and database, but they can behave differently according to communities rules. let's Check [coogger.com](http://www.coogger.com) and [steemkitchen.com](http://www.steemkitchen.com)
